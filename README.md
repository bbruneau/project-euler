# project-euler
Project Euler questions, attempted functionally with Ramda.
It is not supposed that these are the most efficient ways to answer these questions, it's really just for kicks.

Each answer can be run on the commandline:
```$ node 001/run.js```

Some can be passed additional arguments:
```$ node 001/run.js 1000```
